## Overview  
**Hypernode Line** is a communication and orchestration module within the **Hypernode Network**, designed to establish secure, low-latency, and resilient data pipelines between distributed nodes.  
It acts as the **connective layer** between agents, infrastructure modules, and analytical services across the Hypernode ecosystem.

The project ensures reliable transmission of data, commands, and telemetry through optimized protocols that prioritize both performance and stability.

---

## Purpose  
The primary objective of Hypernode Line is to enable **real-time message exchange** and **synchronized operations** across a decentralized computing network.  
It serves as the backbone for communication, ensuring that every node, process, or subsystem in the Hypernode architecture can interact efficiently and securely.

---

## Core Features  
- üîó **End-to-End Node Communication:** Facilitates persistent and encrypted message channels between nodes.  
- ‚ö° **Low Latency Transport:** Uses optimized asynchronous message queues for fast delivery.  
- üß© **Protocol Agnostic:** Supports multiple communication standards (TCP, WebSocket, gRPC).  
- üîÅ **Retry and Failover System:** Automatic reconnection and message replay for reliability.  
- üì° **Telemetry Support:** Integrates with Hypernode‚Äôs monitoring layer for real-time tracking.  
- üß† **Smart Routing:** Dynamic routing based on node availability and workload.  
- üß± **Modular Design:** Built to integrate seamlessly with other Hypernode components.

## Architecture  
Hypernode Line sits at the core of the communication stack, managing how information flows between distributed systems. It consists of the following components:

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `LineServer.java` | Central service responsible for establishing and maintaining node connections. |
| `MessageChannel.java` | Manages message creation, encryption, and delivery pipelines. |
| `NodeSession.java` | Handles session-level communication and connection persistence. |
| `Router.java` | Routes messages dynamically to the most appropriate target node. |
| `LineConfig.java` | Defines configuration parameters such as port, encryption, and timeout settings. |
| `MetricsCollector.java` | Tracks and logs communication metrics for observability and diagnostics. |

## Integration with the Hypernode Ecosystem  
Hypernode Line is part of a broader decentralized infrastructure framework that includes:  
- **Hypernode LoadBalancer** ‚Äì Distributes workload intelligently across network nodes.  
- **Network and Communication Infrastructure** ‚Äì Manages node registration, heartbeats, and core networking.  
- **Performance Analyzer** ‚Äì Monitors and evaluates node performance metrics.  

Together, these modules enable a scalable, intelligent, and autonomous network architecture.
